    "\n",
    "### Class\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state\n",

    "obj = ClassName()\n",
    "print(obj.atrr)\n",
    "\n",
    "Class creates a user-defined data structure, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A class is like a blueprint for an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Classes are created by keyword class.\n",
    "2. Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.\n",
    "3. Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator. Eg.: Myclass.Myattribute\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "An Object is an instance of a Class. A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a copy of the class with actual values. It’s not an idea anymore, it’s an actual dog, like a dog of breed pug who’s seven years old. You can have many dogs to create many different instances, but without the class as a guide, you would be lost, not knowing what information is required.\n",
    "An object consists of : \n",
    "\n",
    "State: It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.\n",
    "Behaviour: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects.\n",
    "Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    " ### self method\n",
    "The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class:\n",
    "\n",
    "### __init__method\n",
    "\n",
    "The __init__ method is similar to constructors in C++ and Java. Constructors are used to initialize the object’s state. Like methods, a constructor also contains a collection of statements\n",

This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. Those types of variables are known as private variables."

The class that derives properties is called the derived class or child class and the class from which the properties are being derived is called the base class or parent class. The benefits of inheritance are:\n",
